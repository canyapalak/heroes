Heroes app provides comprehensive details about over 700 different superheroes from different universes. It was built using the superheroapi.com API and was created with React, Firebase, and Bootstrap.

Users can register and log in to gain access to the full range of features, including adding and removing superheroes to/from their favorites list, and posting, editing, and deleting comments in the chatroom.

The superheroes' stats are shown with bars for easy understanding, providing a unique and enjoyable user experience. The website is 100% responsive and runs smoothly on screens of all sizes, including mobile phones with small screens.

The goal of the project was to combine Firebase features like Authentication, Firebase DB and Storage with React and	by this way create a platform that would provide extra functions for registered/logged in users.
